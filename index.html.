            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>Martin Luther King devoted much of his life to the struggle for equality and recognition of the rights of the black population, and against violence and racial discrimination in the United States. Discrimination that completely cracked American society. "I have a dream". This beautiful plea defended peace and equality among human beings.Black Power,Black Muslims,Black Panthers..They all wobbled the foundations raised by Martin Luther King.
